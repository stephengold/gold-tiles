This wiki page explains the gold-tiles game to players.

== The rules ==

Gold-tiles is a turn-based tile game for one or more players.
You can play solitaire, or play against the computer, or
play with other people on the same computer.

=== Tiles and their attributes ===

The playing pieces are two-sided square (or hexagonal) *tiles* with colored *markings* on the side known as the *face*.  Tile markings 
denote the *values* of the tile's *attributes*.

In any particular game, all tiles have the same number of attributes.
The number of attributes and the number of a values for
each attribute are decided at the start of each game.
Tiles typically have two attributes, one denoted by a geometric 
shape and the other denoted by the color of that shape.  However, 
there can be up to five attributes, with all or some values 
denoted by letters or numbers.

Each attribute takes at least four values but not more than ten.
For instance, in a five-color game the color attribute might 
take the values _black_, _red_, _blue_, _green_, and _purple_.
In a four-shape game, the shape attribute might take the 
values _circle_, _square_, _triangle_, and _star_.

The tiles used in a particular game include at least one with every 
possible combination of attribute values.  Games may also 
include *clones*--tiles with identical markings (which 
therefore match in every attribute).  The number of clones
per combination is decided at the start of each game.

Two tiles are *compatible* if exactly one of their attributes 
matches (has the same value).  If none of their attributes 
match, then the tiles are not compatible.  Nor are they 
compatible if two or more of their attributes match.
(Consequently, clones are never compatible.)

For instance, a tile having red markings is compatible 
with any tile having black markings, provided their markings 
are otherwise identical.  A tile marked with a square
is compatible with any tile marked with a circle, provided 
their markings are otherwise identical.  And so on.
 
=== Locations for tiles ===

Each player has one or more *hands* which contain tiles belonging 
to that player.

The players share a board and a stock bag.  A player can 
access these locations only during his/her turn.

There is also a swap area, used to perform special moves 
called swaps.

==== Players' hands ====

Players' hands are limited in the number of tiles they can hold.

The number of tiles in each hand is visible to all players,
and a player can see the markings on his/her own tiles.
However, players generally cannot see the markings on 
tiles in other players' hands.

==== Board ====

The *board* is a two-dimensional grid of *cells*.
The cells are typically arranged in a square or hexagonal grid, 
with each cell *adjacent* to four or six or eight neighboring cells.

The board has an *origin* (starting cell), where the first
tile must be placed.  The board has no edges or other 
features.  It grows as needed in all directions.

Each cell starts out empty.  An *empty* cell becomes 
*full* when a player *places* a tile face-up on the cell.
Placed tiles cannot be moved.  Once filled, a cell 
remains full until the end of the game.  Once placed 
on a cell, a tile remains there until the end of the game.

==== Stock bag ====

The *stock bag* contains all the unplayed tiles which don't 
belong to any player.  Players obtain tiles by *drawing*
from the stock bag blindly -- without looking at 
their markings.

==== The swap area ====

A player may return tiles to the stock bag on his/her
turn.  To avoid drawing back the returned tiles, s/he
places them temporarily into a private *swap area* 
while drawing replacements.

=== Setup ===

At the start of the game, all cells on the board are
empty (unplayed) and all tiles reside in the stock bag.

Each player blindly draws tiles from the stock bag until
his/her hand is full, then bids for the first turn by
announcing how many tiles s/he has which are mutually
compatible.

The player with the largest set of mutually-compatible
tiles takes the first turn.  On that turn s/he must play
the number of tiles s/he bid.

=== Taking turns ===

A player's *turn* consists of making a *move* and then
blindly drawing replacement tiles from the stock bag until
either his/her hand is full or the stock bag is empty.

There are four legal moves:
 * The player may *play* one or more tiles from his/her hand to the board, filling empty cells in order to earn points.
 * The player may *swap* -- return one or more tiles from his/her hand to the stock bag by way of the swap area.
 * The player may *pass* -- do nothing.
   In this case, s/he does not draw any replacement tiles.
 * The player may *resign* and drop out of the game.
   In this case, the tiles in his/her hand return to the stock bag
   and s/he does not draw replacements.

At the end of a player's turn, if the player has played all
the tiles in his/her hand and is unable to draw any replacements
(because the stock bag is empty) then s/he *goes out*, and the 
game is over.  Otherwise, the *next player* (the one on his/her 
left) takes turn.

==== Playing ====

Every tile played to the board must fill an empty cell.

Except for the origin (filled on the first turn), each 
cell which is filled must have at least one neighbor which 
is already full.  In other words, all full cells on
the board must be interconnected.

The tiles placed in a single play must lie in a single row
or column of the board, with no empty cells intervening.

If two or more tiles are placed in single row or
column without any intervening empty cells, they must
all be mutually compatible.  (Consequently, tiles in 
adjacent cells must always be compatible.)

==== Swapping ====

The number of tiles returned during a swap must not exceed
the number of tiles in the swap bag.

=== Game over ===

A game ends normally when the stock bag is empty and one player
has no tiles in his/her hand.

Alternatively, the game may end when all players except one
have resigned.
