== Builds ==

There are two builds of the gold-tiles application:

 * gold-tiles-windows - The main product, targeting the Microsoft Windows(tm) platform.

This build implements a graphical user interface (GUI) which 
assumes the presence of a mouse or other pointing device.
The graphics are based on GDI.  The _WINDOWS preprocessor macro 
is defined.

 * gold-tiles-console - implements a console user interface.

This is barely playable and used mainly for debug.  It might 
also be of interest to users wishing to play remotely (over 
telnet/rsh) or users lacking a pointing device.

== Coding standards ==

=== Source files ===

Source files needed only for GUI builds belong in src/gui.

Every header file should use #ifndef to prevent multiple inclusions.

For every class Foo there should ideally be a header file "foo.hpp" 
and a code file "foo.cpp".

Project-wide definitions belong in "project.hpp"

=== Identifiers ===

 * class names - use MixedCaseStartingWithUppercase
 * member variables -
 * methods - 
 * function parameters
 * local variable names - use mixedCaseStartingWithLowercase
 * enum values - use ALL_UPPER_CASE
 * preprocessor macros - use ALL_UPPER_CASE

=== Indentation ===

TBD
